## Textural Feature Extraction
When we touch a surface in daily life, we can understand the rough, rigit and silky properties of that surface. These features are called "textural features". The same is true for images. By considering the gray pixel values ​​of an image, we can find the textural properties of that image. Shapes or patterns in an image can repeat, make smooth transitions, and be in a certain pattern. By analyzing these textural features, some mathematical conclusions can be drawn. Statistical methods are available to analyze these textural features. These methods can be classified as first order, second order and higher order.
## 1) First Order Textural Measures
First-order textural analysis infers meanings by considering the original values ​​of pixels in an image. For example, mean, variance, standard deviation can be given.
## 2) Second Order Textural Measures
In second-order textural analysis, it analyzes the relationship of pixels with each other. One way to calculate quadratic textural analysis is the gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) proposed by Haralick et al. (1973). GLCM is a matrix of gray pixel values ​​of an image based on the relationship between two pixels in different directions. There are some textural measurements derived from the Gray Level Co Occurence Matrix.
